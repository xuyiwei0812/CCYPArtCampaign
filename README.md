# CCYP Art Campaign - Through Their Eyes

This project is developed in collaboration with **Commissioner for Children and Young People Western Australia (CCYP WA)** to raise awareness about poverty from children's perspectives through art. The **CCYP Art Campaign** provides a platform for young people to express their thoughts on poverty using various creative forms such as paintings, digital art, short videos, and music. The website was entirely developed by me using the **Vue.js** framework. It enables users to explore artworks, participate in the campaign, and share their creations on social media. This initiative helps amplify children's voices and fosters meaningful discussions about poverty.
